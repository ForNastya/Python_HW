Canada is well-known for its warm people, breathtaking scenery, and forward-thinking judicial system. However, 
hidden beneath the surface of its current laws is a fascinating array of peculiar and peculiar laws that have attracted 
the interest of both Canadians and foreigners. In this article, youâ€™ll discover some of Canada's most odd laws, from 
prohibitions on paint colors to rules governing maple syrup, and explain their historical context and cultural influences.

No Purple Garage Paint
The town of Kanata, Ontario, enacted a bylaw preventing people from painting their garage doors purple in the early 1990s. 
This strange law's justification is still up for dispute. Some feel it was a move made for aesthetic reasons to keep a 
consistent appearance in residential neighborhoods, while others think it was made to protect property values.

No Coins for Payment
According to Section 8 of the Canadian Currency Act, no one is required to accept more than 25 coins at once as payment for 
a transaction. The rule was probably enacted to encourage the use of banknotes and electronic payment methods and to stop 
businesses from having to deal with an excessive amount of coins.

Maple Syrup Regulations
When it comes to maple syrup, Canada takes no chances; a whole act of rules is devoted to the sweet domestic product. 
One of them reads: "No person shall market a product in import, export, or interprovincial trade in such a manner that it 
is likely to be mistaken for a maple product for which a grade or standard is established under these Regulations." 
This particular regulation prohibits making false claims about a product's identity as maple syrup.
